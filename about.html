       <center><p class="about">I received money on my birthday a week ago. I put the â‚¹200 away and continued partying. The party was so amazing I totally forgot about the money. The next day I could not find the money. I was really worried. I searched my whole room. Then I remembered I put the money in one of my old shirt pocket. I went to my closet searched crazily for the shirt because I wanted to buy a beautiful Holi card for my family. When I could not find it, I remembered sadly I gave the shirt to charity. Then I got an idea of an amazing and new website and told my friends about my wonderful idea. From my it turned to we. My friends were so helpful, kind and sweet that we created this website.</p></center>
